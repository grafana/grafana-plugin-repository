- Read the [Review Guidelines](http://docs.grafana.org/plugins/developing/plugin-review-guidelines/) before submitting your plugin. These guidelines determine if the plugin is ready to be published or not.

- Commercial plugins require a plugin subscription to be published. Commercial plugin subscriptions help us fund continued development of our open source platform and software. See the [terms](https://grafana.com/terms) for more details.

- If possible, for datasource plugins please provide a description on how to set up a simple test environment. A docker container or simple install script helps speed up the review process a lot.
